        <h3>About Webb SPACE TELESCOPE</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
          Webb is NASA’s largest and most powerful space science telescope
  ever constructed. Webb’s enormous size and frigid operating
  temperature present extraordinary engineering challenges. After
  launching from French Guiana, the observatory will travel to an orbit
  about one million miles away from Earth and undergo six months of
  commissioning in space—unfolding its mirrors, sunshield, and other
  smaller systems; cooling down; aligning; and calibrating. Astronomers worldwide will then be able to conduct scientific observations
  to broaden our understanding of the universe. Webb will also complement the science achieved by other NASA missions.

      <p><H3>Quick Facts</H3></p>
      <p>
          <li><b> MIRROR SIZE:</b> 21.3 feet
          (6.5 meters) across
          </li>
          <li> <b>SHAPE:</b> The mirror is comprised
          of 18 gold-plated hexagonal deployable
          segments </li>
          <li><b>SUNSHIELD:</b>Webb’s five-layer deployable
            sunshield is the size of a tennis court</li>
            <li> <b>INSTRUMENTS:</b> Webb has four science
              instruments: Near-Infrared Camera
              (NIRCam), Near-Infrared Spectrograph
              (NIRSpec), Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI),
              and Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless
              Spectrograph (NIRISS) with the Fine
              Guidance Sensor (FGS)</li>
              <li><b>WAVELENGTHS:</b> Visible, Near Infrared,
                Mid Infrared (0.6-28.5 micrometers)
                </li>
                <li><b> DISTANCE:</b> 1 million miles
                  (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth</li>
                  <li><b> IN SPACE:</b> Orbiting the Sun
                    around the second Lagrange point (L2)</li>

    <p><h3>Seeking Light from the First
      Galaxies in the Universe</h3></p>
      <p>Webb will directly observe a part of space and time never seen
        before. Webb will gaze into the epoch when the very first stars and
        galaxies formed, over 13.5 billion years ago. Ultraviolet and visible
        light emitted by the very first luminous objects has been stretched
        or “redshifted” by the universe’s continual expansion and arrives
        today as infrared light. Webb is designed to “see” this infrared light
        with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. </p>
        <p><h3>Exploring Distant Worlds
          and the Solar System</h3></p>
          <p>Webb will also be a powerful tool for studying the nearby universe.
            Scientists will use Webb to study planets and other bodies in our
            solar system to determine their origin and evolution and compare
            them with exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. Webb will
            also observe exoplanets located in their stars’ habitable zones, the
            regions where a planet could harbor liquid water on its surface, and
            can determine if and where signatures of habitability may be present.
            Using a technique called transmission spectroscopy, the observatory
            will examine starlight filtered through planetary atmospheres to
            learn about their chemical compositions.</p>
